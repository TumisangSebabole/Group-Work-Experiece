# Group Work Experiece
For a recent assignment, I was paired into a group where I did not know anyone beforehand. Being naturally shy, I initially struggled to feel like I belonged. Most of the other members were familiar with each other, which made it even more challenging for me to contribute confidently during our early discussions.

During the Forming stage, we tried to introduce ourselves and discuss how to approach the assignment. I mostly listened rather than spoke, observing the group dynamics and trying to find a way to fit in. Although I was nervous, this stage allowed me to understand each member’s strengths and working style.

The Storming stage came sooner than expected. A minor dispute arose between two friends in the group over the direction of the assignment, which caused some tension and delayed our progress. Initially, I felt anxious, unsure how to contribute to resolving the disagreement. Eventually, we decided to address the issue openly, discussing everyone’s opinions and agreeing on a compromise that incorporated ideas from both sides. This helped us move forward and restored a sense of collaboration.

As we continued working, our group began to Norm, establishing routines such as weekly check-ins and assigning specific tasks to each member. This helped me find my role in the group, and I gradually became more confident in sharing my ideas.

By the Performing stage, we were functioning effectively as a team. Each member contributed their strengths, communication improved, and we were able to complete the assignment efficiently. I felt a sense of belonging and accomplishment, realizing that my shy nature didn’t prevent me from contributing meaningfully.

In the Adjourning stage, our group concluded the assignment with a sense of closure. The earlier tension had been resolved, and there was mutual appreciation for everyone’s contributions. Although I initially struggled to integrate, I left the experience with a better understanding of teamwork and communication.
